StackOverflow Analysis

•	Description: Utilize Scala, Parallel Computing(spark), and Machine Learning with Dataproc to clusters over 1,000,000 posts on the popular question-answer platform StackOverflow according to their score

•	Transform and aggregate posts using Spark into a score RDD, and then construct vector RDD for clustering

•	Implement distributed k-means cluster in Scala from scratch, define learning rate and max iteration

•	Write a script to initialize Dataproc clusters, submit the job, and delete the clusters after job finishes for cost saving
